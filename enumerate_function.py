# python enumerate() is a built-in Python function. THE enumerate() allows you to loop over an iterable object
# and keep track of how many iterations have occured. Enumerate is particularly useful if you have an array 
# of values that you want to run through entirely.
#l1 = ['bhindi', 'aloo', 'chopsticks', 'chowmein']

# i = 1
# for item in l1:
#     if i%2 is not 0:
#         print(f"Jarvis please buy {item}")
#     i += 1

# for index, item in enumerate(l1):
#     if index%2 == 0:
#         print(f"jarvis please buy {item}.")
